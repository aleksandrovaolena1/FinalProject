# Final Project

Welcome to **Final Project**! This Python-based project aims to create an application that automates the search for hotel information using the Google Maps API and publishes the results to a Telegram channel. This solution will help quickly find detailed information about hotels, including photos and descriptions, addresses, and reviews, and share it with clients through a promotional Telegram channel.

## Features

### Hotel Search:
- Utilizes the Google Maps API to search for hotels by name.
- Returns detailed hotel information, including location, description, and user reviews.

### Detailed Hotel Information:
- Fetches comprehensive data about hotels, such as address, amenities, and ratings.
- Retrieves photos of the hotel to provide visual context.

### User Reviews Display:
- Extracts guest reviews and displays them alongside hotel details.
- If no reviews are available, shows a default message ("No reviews available").

### Telegram Integration:
- Sends formatted hotel information and photos directly to a promotional Telegram channel.
- Ensures easy sharing of hotel data with clients through an automated process.

### Formatted Output:
- Outputs hotel information in a well-structured, readable format with emojis for better visual appeal.
- Makes it easy for clients to quickly read and understand key hotel details.

### Interactive User Input:
- Prompts the user to enter the name of the hotel, allowing for quick and personalized searches.
